# Internet Of Things

## What is IoT?
The internet of things is a system of devices connected to a network that collect, share, or use data. Devices in the network often gather data from their surroundings, automate tasks, or share data with other devices. Most of the network devices share the data using the internet but they can also work on a local network. Not all devices are apart of an IoT. 

## What Networks Does IoT Use?
Devices use many different networks to connect with each other some of these networks include:

- **Wi-Fi** - A wireless network allowing devices to connect to the internet and communicate with each other over a wireless network. Used in smart homes, phones, computers, game consoles, and most other devices connected to the internet. Used for high speeds.

- **Bluetooth** - Wireless communication between devices in short to medium ranges. Uses radio waves and typically has a range of 10-100 meters. Includes wireless earbuds, some smart home devices, wireless headphones, and wireless sensors.

- **NFC** - Short range wireless communication between devices used for secure data transfer. Usually only has a range of a few centimeters. Typically used for smart locks, credit cards, certain smart watch functions, and tags.

## How Do IoT Devices Affect Performance On The Internet?

All wifi networks have a certain amount of **bandwidth**(the max amount of data that can be transmitted is a certain amount of time usually in bits per second). Each device connected to a wifi network consumes a certain amount of bandwidth. The more devices are connected the more bandwidth is used. If too many devices are connected the bandwidth for each device will be limited per device and performance will be slower causing side effects like buffering, lag, and slow loading speeds.

## Real World Examples
A device is part of an IoT if it communicates with another device using a network and collects or uses data in some way. Some example of IoT are:

- Fitness Trackers like Fitbit, Garmin, Xiaomi collect your fitness data like steps,heart rate,and sleeping patterns. It connects to your smartphone via Bluetooth and the smartphone syncs the data to a cloud platform, allowing you to view detailed insights in an app.

- Smart Home Devices like Bluetooth Bulbs use your phone to turn on lights via Bluetooth. If you leave the house,a hub lets you control the lights over the internet.

Some examples of non IoT devices are:

- Standard kitchen appliances such as toaster, ovens, blenders, etc

- Alarm clock that dont connect to any other devices

- Fans only connected to power
