# Internet Of Things

## Info 
The internet of things is a system of devices connected to a network that collect, share, or use data. Devices in the network often gather data from their surroundings, automate tasks, or share data with other devices. Most of the network devices share the data using the internet but they can also work on a local network. Not all devices are apart of an IoT. 
## Real World Examples
A device is part of an IoT if it communicates with another device using a network and collects or uses data in some way. Some example of IoT are:

- Fitness Trackers like Fitbit, Garmin, Xiaomi collect your fitness data like steps,heart rate,and sleeping patterns. It connects to your smart phone via Bluetooth and the smart phone syncs the data to a cloud platform, allowing you to view detailed insights in an app.

- Smart Home Devices like Bluetooth Bulbs use your phone to turn on lights via Bluetooth. If you leave the house,a hub lets you control the lights over the internet.

Some examples of non Iot devices are:

- Standard kitchen appliances such as toaster, ovens, blenders, etc

- Alarm clock that dont connect to any other devices

- Fans only connected to power
